***Product and 'concrete' Product***

Whlie implementing the `Factory Pattern`, we refer to certain classes as the `Product` and the `concrete Profuct`. In this code, we are using the class `Pet` as the `Product`. The `Product` can usually be created as an `interface` or `abstract`, but this isn't always neccessary. The `Product` acts as a blueprint for subclasses to be made from.
```java
abstract class Pet{

    String name;

    Pet(){}

    Pet(String aName){}

    abstract void makeSound();
    public void setName(String aName){
        name = aName;
    }
    abstract void setFriend(Pet p);
}
```
While the `Concrete Product` is where the creation of each instance is handled. This is done in subclasses that are called by the factories `getPet()` method. Depending on what type of 'factory' is calling it, the `getPet()` method is `Overriden`. 
```java

class DogFactory extends PetFactory {

    public Pet getPet(){   //Overidden 'getPet()' from 'Pet'
        return new Dog();  // Calls concrete 'Dog' constructor
    }
}

class Dog extends Pet{

    Dog(){
        super();    // Calls super 'Pet' constructor
    }
    Dog(String aName){...}

    public void makeSound(){...}
    public void setName(String aName){...}
    public void setFriend(Pet p){...}
}
```

***How to identify this variant of factory as distinct from another***



```java
class PetFactory{}
class DogFactory extends PetFactory{} 

class Pet{} // Product
class Dog extends Pet{} // Concrete Product
```
